# PROJECT DISCONTINUED
# NuInfoSys
## Future Goals
* Custom Images (DOTS files)
* Custom Animations (Chaining DOTS files)
* Image + Animation Designer Web App / Software
* A way to know if the current animation list would require too much
memory would be really cool, but would take some investigation

## Running from the CLI
In order to run NuInfoSys from the command line, use the following
command:
```python3.6 -m NuInfoSys.MODULE```
Usually MODULE will be betabrite (i.e. ```python3.6 -m NuInfoSys.betabrite```

## Current Goals, in Rank of Needed Completion
* Memory management
